# CNN CIFAR-10 Classification 
For this project, I used the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 images across 10 different classes. My goal was to deploy the best model to classify these 10 classes. I also experimented with style transfer techniques for images with different styles.
Results: When initial results were unsatisfactory, I applied data augmentation techniques (rotation, zoom, shift range) to improve performance. I also implemented early stopping to prevent overfitting, which contributed to better test accuracy.
